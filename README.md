# Mid Boot Camp Project

This project is about the NYC subway system. Specifially about the turnstile use and what the popular stations are. 

In this project I have cleaned the data, made a function to clean a years worth of data to see everything on a bigger scope. 
I have a hypothosis that I test to see if there are more than 800 exits per hour. 

In addition to the data and hypothosis test, I have also added my tableau presentation.
